# CS98 Hack a Thing 1
Alan Lu and Yeonjae Park
For our Hack a Thing project, we are going to be following some Unity tutorials to hopefully make something cool. We have both had interest in game development for a while so this should be a good fit.

Tutorial 2: Tower Defense Game https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/tower-defense-template
