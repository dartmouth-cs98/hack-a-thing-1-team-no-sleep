# CS98 Hack a Thing 1
Alan Lu and Yeonjae Park  
For our Hack a Thing project, we are going to be following some Unity tutorials to hopefully make something cool. We have both had interest in game development for a while so this should be a good fit. We mostly sat side-by-side while doing these tutorials and switched off using the computer between different parts. 
  
## Tutorial 1: Match 3 Game https://www.raywenderlich.com/673-how-to-make-a-match-3-game-in-unity  
This was a simple match 3 game that we both worked on side by side while watching the tutorial. We switched who used the computer for certain sections of the tutorial. In the end, we created a functioning match 3 game. Having known nothing about Unity before, we learned the basics of GameObjects, Prefabs, Assets, Scripting in C#, etc. and how everything interacted.
## Tutorial 2: Tower Defense Game https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/tower-defense-template  
After trying the simpler tutorial above, we decided to try this tower defense game, but unfortunately it was too complicated and we could not follow some of the instructions. Regardless, we definitely learned a bit about Unity playing around with the Assets they gave us. We made multiple GameObjects, Prefabs, and Scripts. This project came with a complete demo project, and we attempted to recreate the different towers and enemies.
## Tutorial 3: Space Shooter Game https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial 
In this last tutorial, we created a space invaders-like game complete with shooting, explosions, particles, sounds, etc. This solidified understanding of what we learned in the previous two tutorials and especially helped understanding with the C# scripting and how to connect that with the different Assets in Unity.

## Build Instructions
To build, you can open the project in Unity and build for your respective platform. You can also just play the game directly by selecting an appropriate scene and clicking Play within Unity.
